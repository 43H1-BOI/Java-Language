<h1>Functions And Methods</h1>

### Question 1 :

1. [ ] Write a Java method to compute the average of three numbers..

### Question 2 :

1. [ ] Write a method named isEven that accepts an int argument. The method
   should return true if the argument is even, or false otherwise. Also write a program to test your
   method.

### Question 3 :

1. [ ] Write a Java program to check if a number is a palindrome in Java? ( 121 is a
   palindrome, 321 is not)
   A number is called a palindrome if the number is equal to the reverse of a number e.g., 121 is a
   palindrome because the reverse of 121 is 121 itself. On the other hand, 321 is not a
   palindrome because the reverse of 321 is 123, which is not equal to 321.
