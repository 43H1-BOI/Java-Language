    /*
     A class which is declared with the abstract keyword is known as an abstract class in Java.
     It can have abstract and non-abstract methods (method with the body).
     The main motive of Abstract class is to Bind up all the Important methods and data members in a single class and then
     reuse them in child class.

     * Objects of Abstract Class Cannot be Created
     * Methods can be Abstract or Non-Abstract
     * Abstract Methods can be defined only inside abstract class and then defined in child class
