Abstraction :-

Data abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user.
Abstraction can be achieved with either abstract classes or interfaces
OR
Hiding all the unnecessary details and showing only important parts to the user.
OR
Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.

Two Types :-
    1. Abstract Class --> 0-100% Abstraction
    2. Interfaces --> Total Abstraction

Abstract Class :-
     A class which is declared with the abstract keyword is known as an abstract class in Java.
     It can have abstract and non-abstract methods (method with the body).
     The main motive of Abstract class is to Bind up all the Important methods and data members in a single class and then
     reuse them in child class.

     * Objects of Abstract Class Cannot be Created
     * Methods can be Abstract or Non-Abstract
     * Abstract Methods can be defined only inside abstract class and then defined in child class


Interface :-
    Class is blueprint of Object.
    Interface is a Blueprint of a Class
    It is used to perform Multiple Inheritance
    It helps in achieving Total Abstraction.

Basic Properties :-
    * Defined by "interface" keyword
    * To inherit we use implement keyword whereas we use extends keyword during inheritance
    * Variable in the interface are final , public and static
    * Used to achieve total Inheritance
