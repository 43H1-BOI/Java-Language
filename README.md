# Conditional Statements

1. Write a Java program that takes a year from the user and print whether that
   year is a leap year or not.
2. Write a Java program to input week number(1-7) and print day of week name
   using switch case.

   even and odd integers.
2. Write a Program to find Factorial of any Numbers
3. Program to Print Multiplication Table of Number
4. Sum of n Even Integer

# Arrays

1. Average of Elements of Array.
2. Checking Duplicate Element in an Array.
3. To Find Maximum and Minimum Element of Array.
4. Program to Create a Copy of Array.
5. Program to Find Sub Arrays of a Array
6. Program to Find Sub Pairs of Array
7. To Find Max Sum of Sub Array using Brute Force Method
8. To Find Max Sum of Sub Array using Prefix Array Method
9. To Rotate Array to it's Right n times

# String and StringBuilder

# Functions And Methods

1. Write a Java method to compute the average of three numbers..
2. Write a method named isEven that accepts an int argument. The method
   should return true if the argument is even, or false otherwise. Also write a program to test your
   method.
3. Write a Java program to check if a number is a palindrome in Java? ( 121 is a
   palindrome, 321 is not)
   A number is called a palindrome if the number is equal to the reverse of a number e.g., 121 is a
   palindrome because the reverse of 121 is 121 itself. On the other hand, 321 is not a
   palindrome because the reverse of 321 is 123, which is not equal to 321.
4. Search about(Google) & use the following methods of the Math class in Java:
* a. Math.min( )
* b. Math.max( )
* c. Math.sqrt( )
* d. Math.pow( )
* e.Math.avg( )
* f. Math.abs( ) <br>

5. Write a Java method to compute the sum of the digits in an integer.
   (Hint : Approach this question in the following way :
   a. Take a variable sum = 0
   b. Find the last digit of the number
   c. Add it to the sum
   d. Repeat a & b until the number becomes 0 )
